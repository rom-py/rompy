    will be given, the second part defines the spectral parameters of these spectra.

    With this optional command a nested SWAN run can be carried out with the boundary
    conditions obtained from a coarse grid SWAN run (generated in that previous SWAN
    run with command NESTOUT). The spectral frequencies and directions of the coarse
    grid run do not have to coincide with the frequencies and directions used in the

    nested run (see Section 2.6.3). To generate the nest boundary in the coarse grid
    run, use command NGRID. For the nested run, use the command CGRID with identical
    geographical information except the number of meshes (which will be much higher for
    the nested run). This BOUNDNEST1 command is not available for 1D computations; in
    such cases the commands SPECOUT and BOUNDSPEC can be used for the same purpose. A
    nested SWAN run must use the same coordinate system as the coarse grid SWAN run.
    For a curvilinear grid, it is advised to use the commands POINTS or CURVE and
    SPECOUT instead of NGRID and NESTOUT.

    With this optional command (not fully tested) a nested SWAN run can be carried out
    with the boundary conditions obtained from a coarse grid WAM run (WAM Cycle 4.5,
    source code as distributed by the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg). The spectral
    frequencies and directions of the coarse grid run do not have to coincide with the
    frequencies and directions used in the nested SWAN run; SWAN will interpolate to
    these frequencies and directions in the nested run (see Section 2.6.3). Note that
    SWAN will accept output of a WAM output location only if the SWAN grid point on the
    nest boundary lies within a rectangle between two consecutive WAM output locations
    with a width equal to 0.1 times the distance between these output locations on
    either side of the line between these WAM output locations. This BOUNDNEST2 command
    is not available for 1D computations. Only boundary conditions generated by WAM
    Cycle 4.5 can be read properly by SWAN. A nested SWAN run may use either Cartesian
    or spherical coordinates. A curvilinear grid may be used in the nested grid but the
    boundaries of this nest should conform to the rectangular course grid nest
    boundaries. WAM output files are unformatted (binary); this usually implies that
    WAM and SWAN have to run on the same computer. For those cases where WAM and SWAN
    run on different types of machines (binary files do not transfer properly), the
    option FREE is available in this command. The distributed version of WAM does not
    support the required free format nesting output; WAM users who modify WAM such that
    it can make formatted output, must modify WAM such that the files made by WAM can
    be read in free format, i.e. with at least a blank or comma between numbers.

    output transfer files (formatted or unformatted) with WW_3 OUTP (output type 1 sub
    type 3) at the locations along the nest boundary (i.e. computational grid points in
    WAVEWATCH III). These locations are equal to the corner points of the SWAN nested
    grid and optionally also distributed between the corner points of the SWAN nested
    grid (the boundary of the WAVEWATCH III nested grid need not be closed and may
    cover land). The locations should be output by WAVEWATCH III in sequence (going
