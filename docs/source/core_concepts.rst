=================================
Core Concepts
=================================

Rompy is a Python library for generating ocean model control files and required input data ready for ingestion into the model.
The framework is separated into two broad concepts:


.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:
   :toctree: _generated/

   rompy.model.ModelRun
   rompy.core.BaseConfig

There is information about each of these in the documentation of each object, but at a hight leve, is the high level framework 
that renders the config object and controls the period of which the model is run, and the config object is responsible for producing 
model configuration. 

If we consider a very simple case using the BaseConfig class. This is not inteded to do anything except provide a bass class on which to implement 
a specific model, however, is is functional and can be used to demonstrate core concepts.


Core objects 
---------------

Grids
^^^^^

Grids form a core component of any model. Rompy provides a base class for grids, and a regular grid class. 
Support for other grid types will be added in the future.


.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:
   :toctree: _generated/

   rompy.core.grid.BaseGrid
   rompy.core.grid.RegularGrid


Data Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data objects are used to represent data inputs into the model. Rompy provides a base class for data objects, and a data object for

.. autosummary::

   :toctree: _generated/

   rompy.core.data.DataBlob
   rompy.core.data.DataGrid



Model Run 
---------------

   rompy.model.ModelRun
