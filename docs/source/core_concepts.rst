Core Concepts
=================================

Rompy is a Python library for generating ocean model control files and required input
data ready for ingestion into the model. The framework is separated into two broad
concepts:


.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:
    :toctree: _generated/

    rompy.model.ModelRun
    rompy.core.BaseConfig

There is information about each of these in the documentation of each object, but at a
high level, is the high level framework that renders the config object and controls the
period of which the model is run, and the config object is responsible for producing
model configuration. 

If we consider a very simple case using the `BaseConfig` class. This is not inteded to
do anything except provide a bass class on which to implement a specific model,
however, is is functional and can be used to demonstrate core concepts.


Core objects 
------------

Grid
^^^^

Grids form a core component of any model. Rompy provides a base class for grids, and a
regular grid class. Support for other grid types will be added in the future.


.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:
    :toctree: _generated/

    rompy.core.grid.BaseGrid
    rompy.core.grid.RegularGrid


Data
^^^^

Data objects are used to represent data inputs into the model. Rompy provides the
following base classes for data objects:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:
    :toctree: _generated/

    rompy.core.data.DataBlob
    rompy.core.data.DataGrid
    rompy.core.data.SourceBase
    rompy.core.data.SourceDataset
    rompy.core.data.SourceFile
    rompy.core.data.SourceIntake


Boundary
^^^^^^^^

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:
    :toctree: _generated/

    rompy.core.boundary.BoundaryWaveStation
    rompy.core.boundary.SourceWavespectra


Spectrum
^^^^^^^^

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:
    :toctree: _generated/

    rompy.core.spectrum.LogFrequency


Model Run 
---------------

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:
    :toctree: _generated/

    rompy.model.ModelRun
