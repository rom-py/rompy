# WAVEWATCH III Model Guide

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation page is a placeholder. WAVEWATCH III model support in Rompy is under active development, and comprehensive documentation is still being created.

## Installation

To use the WAVEWATCH III model with Rompy, install the dedicated plugin:

```bash
pip install rompy-ww3
```

## Overview

WAVEWATCH III (WW3) is a third-generation wave model developed at NOAA/NCEP. It is designed to compute the random, directional wave spectrum and simulate its evolution in time and space. With Rompy, you can configure WW3 simulations using Python objects that are validated with Pydantic, ensuring consistent and reproducible model setups.
