Relocatable Ocean Modelling in PYthon (rompy) is a modular Python library that
aims to streamline the setup, configuration, execution, and analysis of coastal
ocean models. Rompy combines templated model configuration with xarray-based
data handling and pydantic validation, enabling users to efficiently generate
model control files and input datasets for a variety of ocean and wave models.
The architecture centers on high-level execution control (`ModelRun`) and
flexible configuration objects, supporting both persistent scientific model
state and runtime backend selection. Rompy provides unified interfaces for
grids, data sources, boundary conditions, and spectra, with extensible plugin
support for new models and execution environments. Comprehensive documentation,
example Jupyter notebooks, and a robust logging/formatting framework make rompy
accessible for both research and operational workflows. Current model support
includes SWAN and SCHISM, with ongoing development for additional models and
cloud/HPC backends.

Key Features: - Modular architecture with clear separation of configuration and
execution logic - Templated, reproducible model configuration using pydantic
and xarray - Unified interfaces for grids, data, boundaries, and spectra -
Extensible plugin system for models, data sources, backends, and postprocessors
- Robust logging and formatting for consistent output and diagnostics - Example
  notebooks and comprehensive documentation for rapid onboarding - Support for
  local, Docker, and HPC execution backends

rompy is under active developmentâ€”features, model support, and documentation
are continually evolving. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
