Relocatable Ocean Modelling in PYthon (rompy) combines templated cookie-cutter model
configuration with various xarray extensions to assist in the setup and evaluation of
coastal ocean models, and is intended to simplify their configuration, execution and
analysis. This repository also includes Jupyter notebooks that provide examples to
illustrate the use of rompy code, create visualisations and provide inline
documentation.
